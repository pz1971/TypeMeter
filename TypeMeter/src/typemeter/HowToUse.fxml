            <TextArea prefHeight="457.0" prefWidth="578.0" text="1. The Software will give you a script, whenever you press the button, &quot;Start Typing&quot;.&#10;2. There are almost 30 scripts provided with the software by default.&#10;3. The program will randomly select a script for you, and you have to type it as fast as you can.&#10;4. All the scripts are short in length, so you should take less time to complete.&#10;5. When you start typing, a timer on the right side will show you how much time you are taking.&#10;6. Scripts will appear on the top and input area will stay in the bottom.&#10;8. Text of the Scripts will appear in three colors (green, red and black).&#10;9. Green portion defines how much you've typed correctly.&#10;10. Red portion defines the next character you've to type and the portion you typed wrong.&#10;11. Black portion is the portion you haven't type yet.&#10;12. You must clear all the Reds back to get Greens again :D&#10;13. Once you type maximum length (equal to the script), you can't go further. That case, if you have&#10;typed all the characters correctly, Typing session ends and you'll be showed the result (Your speed, &#10;Accuracy, and Required Time).&#10;14. In case, if you reach maximum lenght but has some reds, you have to clean using backspaces&#10;and type them again. Otherwise, the virdict wont be shown.&#10;15. If you take too much time (more than three minutes), means you concentration is not here.&#10;Thus, I suggest you: take some rest, regain your concentration and type again later. :D&#10;16. Oww, You can add your own Scripts (qoutes from movies, from your favourite books, etc.)&#10;and that will be provided only for your tests.&#10;17. Use the profile section to see how you are doing.&#10;18. Option section - I think you know that! XD&#10;19. That's all, Thank you. Happy Typing :D.&#10;***&#10;20. Oh, Shitt! I've missed the point number (7)   :P . Meanwhile I need more practice to gain more&#10;accuracy. :(" />
